The script elastic_search.sh is designed to list all projects that contain Elasticsearch clusters, particularly for projects with IDs starting with mendel-. It uses Google Cloud's gcloud command-line tool to set the project, list instances that serve as Elasticsearch clusters, and outputs their names and zones if found. Hereâ€™s a concise overview of its functionality:
Sets the Active Google Cloud Project: It configures gcloud to use the specified project.
Lists Elasticsearch Clusters: Searches for compute instances labeled as serving the Elasticsearch service and prints their names and zones.
Error Handling: Checks for timeouts or errors in the gcloud commands and handles them appropriately.
Iterates Through Projects: Runs the check across all projects that fit the naming pattern mendel-*.
It is in the form of text file. JUst rename it to sh and run it as well and let me know if any changes are to be made
